            <h2>COVID-19</h2>
            <article>
                The <b>COVID-19 pandemic</b>, also known as the <b>coronavirus pandemic</b>,
                 is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by <b>
                severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</b>. It was first
                 identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared
                  the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and
                   a pandemic in March 2020. As of 12 January 2021, more than 91.3 million cases have
                    been confirmed, with more than 1.95 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.
                <br />
                <br />
                Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to severe illness. The
                 virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other. It leaves an
                  infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person
                   via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces.
                    People remain infectious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if
                     they do not show symptoms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in
                 public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when
                  sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation
                   for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines are being developed and
                    distributed. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms while work is
                     underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus. Authorities
                      worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns,
                       workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also
                        worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.
                <br />
                <br />
                The responses to the pandemic have resulted in global social and economic disruption,
                 including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. It has led to the
                  postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by
                   panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions
                    of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Many educational institutions have been partially
                     or fully closed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media.
                      There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and
                       against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.

            <h2>SARS-CoV-2</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</b> is the virus that causes
                 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by
                   its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human
                    coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). The World Health Organization declared the outbreak
                     a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on
                      11 March 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (and hence Baltimore class IV) that
                 is contagious in humans.As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor
                  to SARS-CoV-1,the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came <u>
                    from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country</u>.
                     Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019
                      and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.
